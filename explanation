This repository was created by Ben as part of the tutorial
it doesn't have any meaningful content but exists for us to test out how the system works without any consequences
we would have to pay a membership fee of 7$(unclear if this is a subscription or one time payment) to have private code repositories
however this system seems optimized for collaborative projects, such as writing code as a group
it has functionality for each of us to have a seperate account and then tracks which changes are submited by each person
It also has a system to manage updating existing content with experimental versions stored as branches

this exists only for me to test out how this system works
this is some text currently exxclusive to the twig branch of this repository
if all goes well it should be added to the master branch
